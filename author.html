        <h2>Teaching Philosophy: Building Intuition</h2>
        <div class="key-point">
            <p>
                <strong>Understanding Through Exploration:</strong> Dr. Delli Carri's teaching approach begins with fundamental questions: "What is this concept really about? Why does it matter? How does it influence the world around us?"
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            His pedagogical approach centres on helping students develop intuition for complex engineering phenomena. Rather than simply presenting equations and theorems, he guides students through the conceptual landscape, explaining fundamental principles and documenting real-world applications and consequences.
        </p>
        <p>
            This teaching philosophy culminates in the creation of interactive applets and simulations, where students can explore counterintuitive but elegant engineering solutions, developing deep understanding through hands-on experimentation.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2>Passion for Engineering Education</h2>
        <p>
            With over 15 years of experience in Higher Education across several European institutions, Dr. Delli Carri has witnessed firsthand the transformative power of effective engineering education. His enthusiasm for teaching is evident in his commitment to making complex engineering concepts accessible and engaging.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Explorable Explanations project represents the culmination of this passion—a belief that engineering education should be:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Interactive and engaging</strong> - Learning by doing, not just reading</li>
            <li><strong>Accessible to all</strong> - Free, web-based tools available 24/7 worldwide</li>
            <li><strong>Intuitive and visual</strong> - Making abstract concepts tangible through simulation</li>
            <li><strong>Rigorous yet approachable</strong> - Maintaining academic excellence while lowering barriers to understanding</li>
            <li><strong>Student-centred</strong> - Designed around how students actually learn, not just how we teach</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2>The Vision Behind Explorable Explanations</h2>
        <p>
            Dr. Delli Carri recognized that many engineering students struggle not because they lack ability, but because traditional teaching methods don't always align with how humans naturally learn complex, abstract concepts. Mathematical formulations and static diagrams, while essential, often fail to convey the dynamic, interconnected nature of engineering phenomena.
        </p>
        <div class="key-point">
            <p>
                <strong>Core Belief:</strong> "The best way to understand complex concepts is to interact with them."
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            This philosophy drives the development of each interactive lecture and simulation. Every applet is carefully designed to help students:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Visualise what equations actually mean in physical terms</li>
            <li>Experiment with "what if" scenarios safely and instantly</li>
            <li>Develop robust mental models through exploration</li>
            <li>Master threshold concepts that unlock deeper understanding</li>
            <li>Build confidence through hands-on experimentation</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2>Commitment to Open Education</h2>
        <p>
            Beyond his role at Coventry University, Dr. Delli Carri is a proponent of open educational resources. The Explorable Explanations project is freely available to students, educators, and self-learners worldwide. This commitment reflects a belief that quality engineering education should not be limited by geography, institution, or financial resources.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through this open-source project, Dr. Delli Carri invites collaboration from the global engineering education community, welcoming contributions that can enhance and extend these learning resources for future generations of engineers.
        </p>
