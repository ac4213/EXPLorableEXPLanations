# Explorable Explanations for Engineering

An interactive web platform offering hands-on simulations and visualisations to help students explore and understand complex engineering concepts through active learning.

## Introduction

This project provides a suite of interactive web-based applets designed to make engineering concepts tangible and accessible. Each applet focuses on a specific principle across various domains including mechanical science, solid mechanics, stress analysis, structural dynamics, and materials science. By enabling direct manipulation of variables and immediate visual feedback, these tools transform abstract theories into concrete experiences.

## Why This Matters for Engineering Students

Engineering education traditionally relies heavily on mathematical formulation and theoretical understanding. While essential, this approach often creates barriers for students who learn best through visual and kinesthetic means. These applets bridge the gap between abstract formulas and physical reality by:

- Making invisible phenomena visible
- Allowing students to test "what if" scenarios in real-time
- Building intuition through experimentation
- Supplementing traditional lectures and textbooks with interactive experiences
- Providing a sandbox environment to explore concepts without fear of failure

## What Is an Interactive Applet?

An interactive applet in this context is a focused web application that:

- Demonstrates a single engineering concept or principle
- Provides interactive controls to manipulate variables
- Displays immediate visual feedback to changes
- Includes contextual information to guide learning
- Requires no installation or special software beyond a web browser
- Functions as a self-contained learning module

Unlike static diagrams or videos, these applets respond to user input, allowing learners to discover relationships between variables through active exploration rather than passive consumption.

## Establishing Threshold Concepts

Threshold concepts are transformative ideas within a discipline that, once understood, fundamentally change how a student perceives the subject. They are often troublesome to grasp through traditional methods. This platform helps establish these concepts by:

- Breaking complex ideas into manipulable components
- Providing multiple representations of the same concept (visual, numerical, graphical)
- Allowing repeated experimentation to build mental models
- Creating "aha moments" through discovery-based learning
- Supporting different learning styles and paces

## Cross-Device Compatibility

The applets are designed with the following principles:

- Responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes
- Touch-friendly interfaces that work on tablets and smartphones
- Mouse and keyboard support for traditional desktop use
- Performance optimisations for both older and modern devices
- Progressive enhancement to provide core functionality across all platforms
- No reliance on cutting-edge features that might limit accessibility

This ensures that students can access these learning tools regardless of their technology resources, making quality engineering education more equitable and accessible.
